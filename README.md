#sudoku_solver
Just a basic Python application that solves Sudoku boards.

The program is written in Python, and offers users a basic text-based interface. Sudoku boards are modeled as a search problem, and a brute force backtracking algorithm is used to solve. The start state of a board are hard-coded into the program (see "given_nums" map), and once the board is solved, users can either reveal the value of a single spot on the overall grid, or can have the program print out the entire board's solution.

Backtracking algorithm loosely based on the psuedo-code provided on the "Sudoku Solving Algorithm" page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms
